# Workshop Selector

@cliff76

Take a look at assignment.txt. I started with just the gui & tried adding event handlers, the issue was that I 
should have started with a separate class and a constructor to create the GUI & it's elements.
well, I started moving things to workshopframe.java and all heck broke loose. 

I wanted to create the other class with the constructors and the event handlers.... 
1 listener for all the elements with ifs for what should happen.
